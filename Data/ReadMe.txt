GPS coordinates are univerally, and more importantly on GPS, are written in 3 major formats : 
    
    1. Degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS): 41°24'12.2"N 2°10'26.5"E
    2. Degrees and decimal minutes (DMM): 41 24.2028, 2 10.4418
    3. Decimal degrees (DD): 41.40338, 2.17403

For an adjustable level of accuracy, considering a 3m radius of error, DD is used for Coordinate generation. 
The coordinates can be easily converted if a different format is being used. 

For now, storage is in text files, later will be converted to SQL bases.

Example: 1.290542 , 103.781539
